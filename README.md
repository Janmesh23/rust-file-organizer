# ü¶Ä Rust File Organizer CLI

A powerful command-line tool built with Rust that automatically organizes files in your directories based on their types, extensions, or custom rules.

## üöÄ Features

- **Smart File Organization**: Automatically sort files by extension, file type, or date
- **Custom Rules**: Define your own organization patterns
- **Safe Operations**: Preview changes before applying them
- **Undo Functionality**: Revert organization operations
- **Multiple Organization Modes**:
  - By file extension (images, documents, videos, etc.)
  - By file size (small, medium, large)
  - By creation/modification date
  - By custom patterns
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Fast & Memory Efficient**: Built with Rust's performance in mind

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Create a `config.toml` file to customize organization rules:

```toml
[general]
create_date_folders = true
backup_enabled = true
max_folder_depth = 3

[extensions]
# Custom extension mappings
[extensions.my_images]
folder = "MyImages"
extensions = ["jpg", "png", "custom_ext"]

[extensions.work_docs]
folder = "WorkDocuments"
extensions = ["docx", "xlsx", "pptx"]

[size_limits]
small = "10MB"
medium = "100MB"
# Files larger than medium go to "Large"

[ignore]
# Files/folders to ignore
patterns = [".git", "node_modules", "*.tmp"]
```

Comprehensive documentation is available in the `docs/` directory:

- **[üìñ Code Walkthrough](docs/CODE_WALKTHROUGH.md)** - Line-by-line explanation of every file
- **[üîß Build & Run Guide](docs/BUILD_AND_RUN.md)** - Complete guide to building and running the project
- **[ü¶Ä Rust Concepts](docs/RUST_CONCEPTS.md)** - Explanation of all Rust concepts used in the project

## üîß Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70.0 or higher

git clone https://github.com/Janmesh23/rust-file-organizer.git
cd rust-file-organizer
cargo build --release
```

### Running
```bash
# Show help
cargo run -- --help

# Preview organization (safe)
cargo run -- organize --dry-run

# Organize by file type
cargo run -- organize ~/Downloads --dry-run

# Organize by file size
cargo run -- organize --mode size --dry-run
```

### Testing
```bash
cargo test
```

## üìñ Examples

### Organize Downloads Folder
```bash
# Preview what would happen
file-organizer organize ~/Downloads --dry-run

# Actually organize

# Undo if needed
file-organizer undo ~/Downloads
```

### Custom Organization
```bash
# Organize only image files
file-organizer organize --filter images

# Organize files older than 30 days
